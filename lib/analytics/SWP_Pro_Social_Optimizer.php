 * The Social Optimizer class will do the same thing as the Gutenberg sidebar,
 * except this one will run the scoring on the server side allowing us to go
 * back through old posts and generate optimization scores for them. This will
 * also make it easier for us to store the grades in the database. We will then
 * use these numbers to make recommendations for the user to go back and optimize
 * their highest performing posts with the least amount of optimizations.
